The purpose of this exercise is to create **React** app to pull data from **YouTube API** and dynamically preview videos depending on keyword entry. There is 300ms delay applied to enable throttling (debounce method from **lodash**)

Change to folder ``cd pandatube-react``
Install dependancies ``npm install``
Run in command line ``npm start``
Access the app at ``localhost:8080``

##Key learnings

- JSX, component, state, setting state
- Class vs Functional based component
- Import/Export of components
- Controlled field element component
- ES6 syntax: arrow function, classes, template strings
- Lodash debounce methods, throttling
